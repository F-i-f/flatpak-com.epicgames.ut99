com.epicgames.ut99 Flatpak manifest without extra data
=======================================================

This is a fork of the [com.epicgames.ut99 Flatpak manifest](https://github.com/flathub/com.epicgames.ut99)
with the extra data removed and embedded like a regular Flatpak.

The output of the build can be installed offline or packaged without any
online dependencies.

Because Epig Games does not want UT99 to be redistributed,
Flatpak from this manifest cannot be made available publicly, but you
can always build your own for offline installation.  This is not legal
advice, please check with your legal counsel.
